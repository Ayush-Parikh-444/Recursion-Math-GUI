**Features:**

1. Calculate Factorials: Users can input non-negative integers to calculate their factorials. The application validates inputs and displays the result in a user-friendly interface.

2. Generate Fibonacci Sequences: Users can generate Fibonacci sequences by specifying a non-negative integer. The GUI showcases the sequence in an organized format.

3. Error Handling: The application provides error handling for invalid inputs, ensuring a smooth user experience.

**Usage:**

- User Interface: This project offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interactions.
- Factorial Calculation:
  - Enter a non-negative integer in the "Calculate Factorial" section.
  - Click the "Calculate" button.
  - The factorial result will be displayed in the result label.
- Fibonacci Sequence Generation:
  - Enter a non-negative integer in the "Generate Fibonacci Numbers" section.
  - Click the "Generate" button.
  - The Fibonacci sequence will be displayed in the result label.

The Recursive Math Functions GUI is a Python application developed with tkinter, designed to simplify recursive mathematical operations. Users can calculate factorials and generate Fibonacci sequences through an intuitive graphical interface. It's not only a practical tool for quick mathematical calculations but also a demonstration of creating user-friendly GUIs and recursion in Python.
